ICT601A2 Job Market Sentiment Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global job market, leading to new trends and challenges for organizations and individuals alike. This project investigates the effects and sentiments of work from home (WFH) in the new hybrid work setting and other emerging trends in the job market through the analysis of multiple open-sourced datasets, including those from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and Kaggle.

The project will:
- Develop a dashboard to visualize and analyze various data relating to labor market trends, sentiments of work from home and office, and the effects of WFH.
- Identify trends, patterns, and forecast analysis for informed decision-making and develop strategies for the future.
- Discover underlying issues and delve deeper via Level of Details (LOD) for optimal resolution and present findings.

The project will provide valuable insights into the changing job market and the impact of remote work on organizations and individuals. It will also help to identify trends, patterns, and underlying issues that can be used to inform decision-making and develop strategies for the future.
